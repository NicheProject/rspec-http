= RSpec HTTP 0.0.2

RSpec HTTP is a RSpec extension library that adds support for writing specs that cover HTTP based API (or more popularly, RESTful APIs). 

To use this library, first add the rspec-http gem to your Gemfile like so:
  gem 'rspec-http', '~> 0.0.1'

Then add the following line to your spec_helper.rb:
  require 'rspec/http'
  
This will make matchers such as the ones listed below available to you in your specs.
  
  response.should be_http_ok
  
  response.should be_http_created
  
  response.should be_http_unprocessable_entity
  
  response.should be_http_im_a_teapot

== Rails

If you're using Rails (and implicitly, rspec-rails), the same matchers will also be available in your controller specs *without* the <code>http</code> namespace. In other words, in your controller specs you can do:

  response.should be_ok

  response.should be_created

  response.should be_unprocessable_entity

  response.should be_im_a_teapot
